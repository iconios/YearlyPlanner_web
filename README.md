Problem Statement: Yearly Planner Application

Managing personal and professional commitments efficiently is a common challenge in todayâ€™s fast-paced world. Many individuals struggle to organize their schedules, set long-term goals, track progress, and maintain a balance between work, personal life, and self-improvement. Traditional planners and digital calendars often lack integrated features for holistic yearly planning, such as goal-setting, habit tracking, and progress visualization, leading to fragmented time management and missed opportunities for growth.

There is a need for a comprehensive yearly planner application that enables users to:

Plan and visualize their entire year in one place.

Set and track personal, professional, and health-related goals.

Manage recurring events, deadlines, and important milestones.

Monitor habits and routines to build consistency.

Receive reminders and insights to stay on track.

Sync across devices for seamless access.

The absence of such a tool results in disorganized schedules, unmet goals, and reduced productivity. A user-friendly yearly planner application would empower individuals to take control of their time, improve accountability, and achieve long-term success.

Objective:
Develop an intuitive and feature-rich yearly planner application that helps users efficiently organize, track, and optimize their year for enhanced productivity and personal growth.

Key Requirements:

Yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily planning views.

Goal-setting and progress-tracking features.

Habit-tracking and reminder systems.

Cross-platform synchronization (mobile, web, desktop).

Customizable themes and export options.

Data insights and performance analytics.

By addressing these needs, the application will provide a structured and motivating way for users to manage their time effectively throughout the year.



# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
